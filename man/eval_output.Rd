\title{Compare STICS simulation outputs (mod_s) to observations (*.obs)}
\usage{
eval_output(dirpath = getwd(), obs_name = NULL, mixed = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dirpath}{Directory path}

\item{obs_name}{A vector of observation file name(s). It must have the form
\code{c(Principal,Associated)} for mixed crops. See details.}

\item{mixed}{(optional) Is the simulation made on mixed species (boolean)}

\item{verbose}{Is informations during execution needed?}
}
\value{
A data.frame (sole crop) or a list of two data.frames (mixed crops) with
simulated and observed data. Simulated and measured data have the \code{_sim}
and \code{_meas} suffix respectively.
}
\description{
Compare STICS simulation outputs to observations for sole or mixed crops.
}
\details{
For mixed crops, the \code{obs_name} argument should have the principal plant
observations first in the character vector, and then the associated plant.
If \code{obs_name} is not provided, the function try to guess it using the
built-in algorithm from \code{\link[=read_obs]{read_obs()}}. Idem for the \code{mixed}
argument. See documentation for more details.
